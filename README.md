# Questions Game
- This is a simple Questions Game. It's about me, let's see how much you know about me. Please don't try to pop any XSS here. You won't be able to do that as I used an `.innerText` property instead of `.innerHTML` property `.innerText` will set an text content of some element such as `textContent` property. So, I hope you will like this little game. 

Thank you for your understanding!
